#### RISC-V to x86-64 binary translator

The rv8 binary translation engine works by interpreting code while
profiling it for hot paths. Hot paths are translated on the fly to
native code. The translation engine maintains a call stack to allow
runtime inlining of hot functions. A jump target cache is used to
accelerate returns and indirect calls through function pointers.
The translator supports hybrid binary translation and interpretation
to handle instructions that do not have native translations.
Currently ‘IM’ code is translated and ‘AFD’ is interpreted. The
translator supports RVC compressed code.

The rv8 binary translator supports a number of simple optimisations:

- Hybrid interpretation and compilation of hot code paths
- Incremental translation with dynamic trace linking
- Inline caching of function calls in hot code paths
- L1 jump target cache for indirect calls and returns
- Macro-op fusion for common RISC-V instruction sequences

#### RISC-V full system emulator

The rv8 suite includes a full system emulator that implements the
RISC-V privileged ISA with support for interrupts, MMIO _(memory
mapped input output)_ devices, a soft MMU _(memory management unit)_
with separate instruction and data TLBs _(translation lookaside
buffers)_. The full system emulator has a simple integrated debugger
that allows setting breakpoints, single stepping and disassembling
instructions as they are executed.

The rv8 full system emulator has the following features:

- RISC-V IMAFD Base plus Privileged ISA (riscv32 and riscv64)
- Simple integrated debug command line interface
- Histograms (registers, instruction and program counter frequency)
- Soft MMU supporting sv32, sv39, sv48 page translation modes
- Abstract MMIO device interface for device emulation
- Extensible interpreter generated from ISA metadata
- Protected address space

#### RISC-V user mode simulator

The rv8 user mode simulator is a single address space
implementation of the RISC-V ISA that implements a subset of the
RISC-V Linux syscall ABI _(application binary interface)_ and
delegates system calls to the underlying native host operating system.
The user mode simulator can run RISC-V Linux binaries on non-Linux
operating systems via system call emulation. The current user mode
simulator implements a small number of [Linux system calls](/syscalls)
to allow running RISC-V Linux ELF static binaries.

The rv8 user mode simulator has the following features:

- RISC-V IMAFD Base ISA (riscv32 and riscv64)
- Simple integrated debug command line interface
- A small set of emulated Linux system calls for simple file IO
- Extensible interpreter generated from ISA metadata
- Instruction logging mode for tracing program execution 
- Shared address space
  - `0x000000000000 - 0x000000000fff` (zero)
  - `0x000000001000 - 0x7ffdffffffff` (guest)
  - `0x7ffe00000000 - 0x7fffffffffff` (host)

#### RISC-V instruction set metadata

The `rv-bin` tool contains a meta-data driven disassembler and
a histogram tool for analysing static register usage and static
instruction usage.

The `rv-meta` tool is able to generate opcode maps, instruction
decoders, source, headers and instruction set listing LaTeX
from ISA metadata. The following is an example of PDF output:

[![RISC-V Instruction Set Listing]({{ site.url }}/images/riscv-instructions.png)](https://github.com/rv8-io/rv8/blob/master/doc/pdf/riscv-instructions.pdf)

RISC-V instruction set metadata is available [here](https://github.com/rv8-io/rv8/blob/master/meta/).
The linked page shows an example [RISC-V Instruction Set Reference](/isa)
generated by the `rv-meta` tool. rv8 has a simple extensible generator
framework that allows reflection on the instruction set metadata to
generate a number of different output formats.

### Optimisations

The rv8 binary translator performs JIT _(Just In Time)_ translation
of RISC-V code to X86-64 code. This is a challenging problem for
many reasons; with the principle challange due to RISC-V having
31 integer registers while x86-64 has only 16 integer registers.

#### Register allocation

rv8 solves the register set size problem by spilling registers
to memory _(L1 cache)_ using a static register allocation (a future
versions may use dynamic register allocator). A large amount of
performance is lost due to register allocations that take advantage
of the larger number of available registers and less frequent stack
spills. It is not possible for the translator to rearrange memory
and registers for optimal stack spills as memory accesses must be
translated precisely. The additional registers are translated as
x86-64 memory operands (which produce load and store micro-ops)
or in some circumstances, explicit `mov` instructions.

RV | | x86 |  | RV | | x86 |  | RV | | x86 |  | RV | | x86
--:| | :-- |  | --:| | :-- |  | --:| | :-- |  | --:| |:--
ra |→| rdx |  | t1 |→| rdi |  | a2 |→| r10 |  | a5 |→| r13
sp |→| rbx |  | a0 |→| r8  |  | a3 |→| r11 |  | a6 |→| r14
t0 |→| rsi |  | a1 |→| r9  |  | a4 |→| r12 |  | a7 |→| r1

The remaining unallocated registers are stored in a memory spill
area accessed using the `rbp` register. e.g. `qword [rbp+0xF8]`
would be used to access `t4`.

#### Translator temporaries

The rv8 translator needs to use several host registers to point
to translator internal structures and for use as temporary
registers for the emulation of many instructions, for example
a store instructions require the use of two temporary registers
if both register operands are in the spill area. The translator
uses the following x86-64 host registers as temporaries leaving
12 registers available for mapping to RISC-V registers:

- `rbp` - pointer to the register spill area and jump target cache
- `rsp` - pointer to the host stack to allow procedure calls
- `rax` - translator temporary register
- `rcx` - translator temporary register

#### CISC vs RISC operands

The rv8 translator makes use of CISC memory operands to access
registers residing in the memory backed register spill area,
which should stay present in L1 cache. The complex memory operands
end up being cracked back into micro-ops in the CISC pipeline
however the use of complex memory operands helps increase instruction
density, which increases performance due to better use of I$
_(instruction cache)_.

There are many combinations of instruction expansions depending
on whether a register is mapped to a live register, is memory backed
and whether there are two or three operands. A three operand RISC-V
instruction is translated into a move and a destructive two operand
x86-64 instruction. Temporary registers are used if both operands
are memory backed. The principle is to maintain the densest
possible mapping to the x86-64 ISA.

Memory operands are used to access registers in the spill area:

![operands]({{ site.url }}/images/operands.svg)

#### Indirect call acceleration

Indirect calls through function pointers cannot be statically
translated as the target address of their translation is not
known at the time of translation. rv8 employs a trace cache
which is a hashtable of guest program addresses to native code
addresses. A full trace cache lookup is relatively slow because
it requires saving caller-save registers and calling into C++
code. To accelerate indirect calls through function pointers,
a small assembly stub looks up the target address in a sparse
1024 entry direct mapped L1 translation cache, and falls back
to a slow translation cache miss path that saves registers and
calls into the translator code to populate the L1 translation
cache so that the next indirect call can be accelerated.

![L1 translation cache]({{ site.url }}/images/cache.svg)

The direct mapped L1 translation cache is indexed by `bits[10:1]`
of the guest address. Bit zero can be ignored because RISC-V
instructions must start on a 2-byte boundary

#### Inline caching

Returns also make use of the L1 translation cache, however a
procedure call made inside of a hot trace can be inlined.
The translator maintains a call stack to keep track of return
addresses. Upon reaching an inlined procedure `RET` (_jalr zero, ra_)
instruction, the link register (`ra` in RISC-V, `rdx` in
the x86 translation) is compared against the callers known
return address and if it matches, control flow continues
along the return path. In the case that the function is not
inlined, the regular L1 translation cache is used to lookup
the address of the translated code.

An inlined subroutine call needs to test the return address:

![inline caching]({{ site.url }}/images/inlining.svg)

#### Branch tail dynamic linking

The translator performs lazy translation of the source program
during tracing and when it reaches branches, it can only link
both sides of the branch if there exists an existing translation
for the not taken side of the branch. To accelerate _branch
tail exits_, the translator emits a relative branch to a
trampoline that returns to the tracer main loop, and the tracer
adds the branch to a table of branch fixup addresses indexed
by target guest address. If the branch target is hot, once
it has been translated, all relative branches that point to
tail exit trampolines will be relinked to branch directly
to the translated native code.

#### Macro-op fusion

The rv8 translator implements an optimisation known as macro-op
fusion whereby specific patterns of adjacent instructions are
translated into a smaller sequence of host instructions. The
macro-op fusion pattern matcher has potential to increase
performance further with the addition of common patterns.
The following is a list of macro-op fusion patterns that are
currently implemented in rv8:

- `AUIPC rs, imm20; ADDI rd, rs1, imm12;`
  - PC-relative address is resolved using a single `MOV` instruction.
- `AUIPC t0, imm20; JALR ra, imm12(t0);`
  - Target address is constructed using a single `MOV` instruction.
- `AUIPC ra, imm20; JALR ra, imm12(ra);`
  - Target address register write is elided.
- `AUIPC rd, imm20; LW rd, imm12(rs1);`
  - Fused into single `MOV` with an immediate addressing mode
- `AUIPC rd, imm20; LD rd, imm12(rs1);`
  - Fused into single `MOV` with an immediate addressing mode
- `SLLI rd, rs1, 32; SRLI rd, rs1, 32;`
  - Fused into a single `MOVZX` instruction.
- `ADDIW rd, rs1, imm12; SLLI rd, rs1, 32; SRLI rd, rs1, 32;`
  - Fused into 32-bit zero extending `ADD` instruction.
- `SRLI r1, rs, imm12; SLLI r2, rs, 64 - imm12; OR r1, r1, r2;`
  - Fused into 64-bit `ROR` with one residual `SHL` or `SHR` temporary
- `SRLIW r1, rs, imm12; SLLIW r2, rs, 32 - imm12; OR r1, r1, r2;`
  - Fused into 32-bit `ROR` with one residual `SHL` or `SHR` temporary

A technique known as deoptimisation can be employed to allow
elision of temporary registers in macro-op fusion patterns
assuming the translator sees the register killed within its
translation window. Deoptimisation requires that the optimised
translation has an accompanying deoptimisation sequence to
fill in elided register values, and this is played back in the
case of a fault (device or debug interrupt) so that the visible
machine state precisely matches that which the ISA dictates. rv8
does not presently implement deoptimisation, however it may
be necessary to allow more sophisticated optimisations.

#### Sign extension versus zero extension

In addition to the register allocation problem, rv8 has to make
sure that 32-bit operations on registers are sign extended instead
of zero-extended. The normal behaviour of 32-bit operations on
x86-64 is to _zero extend_ bit 31 to bit 63 whereas RISC-V _sign
extends_ bit 31 to bit 63. One potential optimisation is lazy sign
extension. It may be possible in a future version of the JIT
translation engine to elide redundant sign extension operations,
however it is important that the register state precisely matches
the semantics of the ISA before executing an instruction that may
cause a fault e.g. loads and stores.

Example of sign-extended vs zero-extended 32-bit arithmetic on RISC-V and x86-64:

![sign-extension vs zero-extension]({{ site.url }}/images/extend.svg)

#### Bit manipulation intrinsics

The bencharks below contain digest algorithms and ciphers which
can take advantage of bit manipulation instructions such as rotate
and bswap. Present day compilers detect rotate and byte swap bitwise
logical operations by matching intermediate representation patterns
that can be lowered directly to bit manipulation instructions such
as `ROR`, `ROL`, `BSWAP` on x86-64. This approach has the benefit
of accelerating code that does not use inline assembly or compiler
builtin functions. RISC-V currently lacks bit manipulation instructions
however there are proposals to add them in the B extension.
The following is a typical byte swap pattern.

- _32-bit integer byteswap pattern (4 constants, 4 shifts, 4 ands, 3 ors)_
  - `((rs1 >> 24) & 0x000000ff) | ((rs1 << 8 ) & 0x00ff0000) |` <br />
    `((rs1 >> 8 ) & 0x0000ff00) | ((rs1 << 24) & 0xff000000)`

rv8 implements rotate macro-op fusion which can translate two
shift instructions and one `OR` instructions with the correct
offsets into one shift and one rotate. The rotate macro-op fusion
needs to create the residual temporary register side effects so
that the register file contents are precisely matched, as it can't
easily prove the residual temporary register is not later used.
Deoptimisation would be required to elide the temporary register.

- _32-bit rotate right or left pattern (2 shifts, 1 or)_
  - `(rs1 >> shamt) | (rs1 << (32 - shamt))`
- _64-bit rotate right or left pattern (2 shifts, 1 or)_
  - `(rs1 >> shamt) | (rs1 << (64 - shamt))`

#### Measurement

A future goal is to quantify the factors that contribute to the
performance differences between native x86-64 code and translated
RISC-V code, so future benchmarks should measure:

- Sign extension overhead
- Indirect call/return overhead
- Macro-op fusion performance improvement
- Register allocation and spilled register accesses
- Work per instruction (fused and unfused micro-ops)

### Logging

`rv-sim` and `rv-sys` support the ability to log instructions
(`--log-instructions`), register values (`--log-operands`) and
`rv-sys` can log page table walks (`--log-pagewalks`).

_Sample output from `rv-sim` with the `--log-instructions` option_

```
$ rv-sim -l build/riscv64-unknown-elf/bin/hello-world-pcrel

### Tracing

The `rv-jit` program supports the ability to log RISC-V instructions
along with the dynamically translated x86-64 assembly and machine code
(`--log-jit-trace`). This mode is useful for JIT translation debugging
and optimisation analysis.

_Sample output from `rv-jit` with the `--log-jit-trace` option_

```
	# 0x0000000000103d70	addi        a0, zero, 1
		mov r8, 1                               ; 41B801000000
		L3:
	# 0x0000000000103d74	slli        a0, a0, 28
		shl r8, 1C                              ; 49C1E01C
		L4:
	# 0x0000000000103d78	addi        a1, zero, -1
		mov r9, FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF                ; 49C7C1FFFFFFFF
		L5:
	# 0x0000000000103d7c	sb          a1, 0(a0)
		rex mov byte [r8], r9b                  ; 458808
		L6:
	# 0x0000000000103d80	lbu         a2, 0(a0)
		movzx r10d, byte [r8]                   ; 450FB610
		L7:
```

### Histograms

The `rv-sim` and `rv-sys` programs support the ability to record and
print histograms. Program counter frequency (`--pc-usage-histogram`),
dynamic instruction frequency (`--instruction-usage-histogram`) and
dynamic register usage (`--register-usage-histogram`) is supported.

The `rv-bin` program via the `histogram` subcommand has the ability
to print static instruction frequency and static register usage.

_Sample output from `rv-sim` with the `--register-usage-histogram`
and `--instruction-usage-histogram` options_

```
$ rv-sim --register-usage-histogram \
         --instruction-usage-histogram \
         build/riscv64-unknown-elf/bin/test-aes

### Linux

This section describes how to build and boot a Linux image in the
full system emulator.

Please read the RISC-V toolchain installation instructions in the
[riscv-gnu-toolchain](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain/)
repository. The `riscv64-unknown-elf` newlib toolchain is required
for building the rv8 test cases and the `riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu`
glibc toolchain is required for building `busybox` which is used to
create the Linux image that runs in the full system emulator.

The toolchain script will download any required dependencies.

_Building riscv-gnu-toolchain_ for linux

```
$ cd riscv-gnu-toolchain
$ make linux
```

The linux build script will download any required dependencies.

_Building linux, busybox and bbl-lite_

```
$ cd rv8
$ export RISCV=/opt/riscv/toolchain
$ export PATH=${PATH}:${RISCV}/bin
$ make linux
```

To start linux, we execute `bbl` (the Berkeley Boot Loader) which
performs early machine set up and then passes control to an
embedded linux kernel. After kernel initialisation, `busybox` is
then executed from the initramfs as pid 1 (init). The linux image
and the initramfs are combined together and linked into bbl as
the boot payload.

_Running the full system emulator_

```
$ rv-sys build/riscv64-unknown-elf/bin/bbl
